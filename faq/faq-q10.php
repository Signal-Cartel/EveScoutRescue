			<p>Wormhole space is, by design, lawless and unconquerable. It is these qualities
				that necessitate our rescue programs in the first place!
				While we respect the inhabitants of every wormhole, it is not feasible to try to 
				contact wormhole locals or residents regarding our operations in "their" system.
				Because wormholes do not allow for sovereignty, it is impossible to tell for
				certain who "owns" a hole.</p>
			<p>But have no fear! The resources we leave behind do not provide any actionable 
				intel nor do we share information about our travels with any third parties. 
				Additionally, our pilots are instructed to avoid placing rescue caches within 
				d-scan range of POSes or Citadels whenever possible, so as to reduce d-scan clutter
				and potentially unwanted traffic near an anchored structure.</p>
			<p>For further inquiries regarding EvE-Scout Rescue's initiatives or policies, or to
				discuss any concerns you might have about rescue operations in the wormhole where
				you reside, please contact <a
