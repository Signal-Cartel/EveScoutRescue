			<p>The pilots of <a href="http://www.signalcartel.com/">Signal Cartel</a>, the core corporation of the <a href="http://www.eve-scout.com/">EvE-Scout Enclave</a> alliance, abide by a strict Credo that emphasizes service to the capsuleer community of New Eden, respect to all regardless of affiliation or play style, non-aggression, friendship, kindness, and grace under pressure.</p>
			<p>Within Signal Cartel, each pilot is encouraged to participate in and invent ways to embody all that the Credo envisions. Our rescue programs are merely one of the myriad ways our pilots strive to live up to that high calling.</p>
			<p>There are many reasons capsuleers fly in New Eden: glory, fame, riches. Our pilots do so to be a part of one of the greatest stories of our time. We derive our glory, fame, and personal reward from the magnificent narrative tapestry we are weaving together. One of our favorite corporate pastimes is sharing with one another stories of successful rescues that occur as the result of our various rescue programs. We are grateful to you for granting us this unique opportunity!</p>
